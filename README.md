# OSA analysis and prediction

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a disorder that brings about repetitive stops of breathing during the sleeping time: a patient suffering from OSA does not get air in his lungs for several intervals while sleeping. Apnea often comes with other symptoms such as headaches, snoring, discontent, forgetfulness, and somnolence.

The aim of this project is to determine the factors that favour the appearance of this disease by analysing a sample of data but also to predict, according to different characteristics, if a subject is likely to be a carrier of the disease or not.
